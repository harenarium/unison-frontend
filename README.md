# Unison

Unison is an app for discovering what tracks and artists you have in common with another Spotify user. After logging in with you Spotify account you can change settings for what you want Unison to be able to compare. Then make connections with other users who have registered for Unison and when they friend you back you will be able to see what songs and artists you both have saved/followed. Great for quickly assembling a playlist for a road trip or feeling out a new karaoke group. A compatibility tester for a first date or a conversation starter with someone you want to get to know better. A safe way to find other people who are secretly into X artist or Y genre.
